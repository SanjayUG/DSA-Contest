/*
Problem statement
Your friend Ninja has been learning about binary numbers lately. In order to understand binary numbers with perfection, Ninja asks you to generate a list of binary numbers from 1 to ‘N’, which he can use later for reference.
For every integer Ninja gives, your task is to generate all the binary numbers from 1 to ‘N’.

Example:
Consider N = 5,
All the binary numbers from 1 to 5 are: 1, 10, 11, 100, 101.
