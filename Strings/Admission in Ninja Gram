Problem statement
Ninja is shifting to a new place named NinjaGram. To take admission to the new school, the teacher gives him a sentence and asks him to check whether the sentence is a pangram.

A word or a sentence is called a pangram if it contains all the English alphabet letters.

Since Ninja is new to programming, he doesn’t have much experience; he asks you to solve the problem. Can you help Ninja figure out whether the sentence is a pangram?

Sample Input 1:
2
12
toosmallword
35
TheQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog
Sample Output 1:
NO
YES
Explanation for Sample Input 1:
In the first test case, the given string is “toosmallword” which contains the characters [‘t’,’o’,’s’,’m’,’a’,’l’,’w’,’r’,’d’], which doesn’t contain all the 26 alphabetic characters. Hence the answer is “NO”.
